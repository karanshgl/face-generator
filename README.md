# Face Generation
A program that uses deep convolutional generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces from the CelebA dataset.
## Discriminator
Uses Leaky ReLu activation for the convolution layers and sigmoid function activation for the output layer. 
## Generator
Uses SWISH activation for the transposed convolution layers and tanh activation for the output layer.
